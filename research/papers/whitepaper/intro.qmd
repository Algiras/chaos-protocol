# Preface {.unnumbered}

This whitepaper presents the CHAOS (Controlled Hedging and Antifragile Optimization Strategy) protocol — a formally verified, mathematically proven volatility harvesting fund built on Cardano.

CHAOS addresses a fundamental challenge in cryptocurrency investing: how to participate in the upside of volatile assets while protecting against catastrophic drawdowns. Our approach combines:

- **Mathematical rigor**: 12 theorems formally proved in Lean 4 with zero `sorry` (Appendix A)
- **Empirical validation**: 2+ years of backtesting across 5 cryptocurrencies
- **Game-theoretic analysis**: Nash equilibrium stability verified; open staking questions explored via agent-based simulation (Appendix B)
- **Stress testing**: 8 historical Black Swan scenarios — drawdown bound holds 8/8, LP floor holds 8/8 (Appendix C)
- **Production-ready architecture**: Aiken smart contracts on Cardano's EUTXO model

All code, proofs, simulations, and data are open source. We encourage the community to reproduce our results, verify our proofs, and contribute to the protocol's development.
