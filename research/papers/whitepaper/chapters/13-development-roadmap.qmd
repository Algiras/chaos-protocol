## Funding Strategy

### Sources

| Source | Amount | Timeline | Certainty |
|--------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Seed round (angel/VC) | $500K-1M | Month 1-2 | Medium |
| Cardano Catalyst grant | $100K-200K | Month 2-4 | Medium |
| LBP proceeds (30% of $37.5M) | $11.25M | Month 8 | Depends on LBP |
| Revenue (fees) | $200K+ | Month 6+ | After TVL |

### Minimum Viable Funding

If full $1.92M is not secured, CHAOS can still launch with reduced scope:

| Budget | Scope | Feasibility |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **$330K** | Phase 1 only (testnet MVP) | Proves concept, attracts further investment |
| **$820K** | Phase 1 + Phase 2 (mainnet) | Generates revenue to self-fund Phase 3 |
| **$1.92M** | Full 12-month roadmap | Optimal path with all features |

---

## Key Risk Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Audit fails | 15% | Budget for fix-and-reaudit cycle |
| Testnet bugs | 30% | 3-week buffer in Phase 1 timeline |
| Slow TVL growth | 35% | Reduce scope, extend timeline |
| Funding shortfall | 35% | Phased approach, bootstrap from fees |
| Key developer leaves | 20% | Documentation, open source, redundancy |
| Regulatory change | 40% | Legal counsel, offshore entity, DAO transition |
